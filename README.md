# Electronic Voting System (Frontend Project)

## Overview
This project is a **web-based Electronic Voting System (EVS)** developed as an academic project.  
It allows voters to authenticate using CNIC and Date of Birth, cast votes securely, and view dynamically generated results via an admin panel.

## Objectives
- Improve accessibility of voting
- Enable fast and transparent vote tallying
- Prevent multiple voting attempts
- Provide a clean and user-friendly interface

## Features
- CNIC & Date of Birth authentication
- Secure vote casting (frontend-based)
- Dynamic vote counting using JavaScript
- Admin panel to display results
- Input validation for user data

## Security Measures (Frontend Level)
- Input validation for CNIC and DOB formats
- Vote buttons disabled after submission
- Temporary data handling using browser local storage

> Note: This is a **frontend-only implementation**; votes are not stored permanently or encrypted.

## Technologies Used
